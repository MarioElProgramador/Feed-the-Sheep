The final proyect following the instructions proposed.

I add an light implementation allowing the player to move the player with UP/DOWN LEFT/RIGHT so the player can alternate the controls.

I tried to do a sheep count of how many sheeps you feed, but the TextMeshProUGUI doesn't work properly to me. So I prefered to use and stable version.
